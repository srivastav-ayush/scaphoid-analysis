# Post-surgery stability of Scaphoid fractures under different fixation configurations: A Finite Element Analysis

## Abstract

Scaphoid fractures are the most common carpal bone fractures, often occurring after a fall onto an outstretched hand. These fractures are difficult to treat and diagnose due to improper blood circulation in the anatomical snuffbox. As a result, research is required to enhance surgery and improve bone recovery. In this study, two cases of accidental Scaphoid fracture are considered (1) person slipping while walking and (2) person falling from a stationary motorbike. Maximum impact loads of 1600 N & 4000 N are calculated for the two cases. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is used to create a fracture in the CAD model of Scaphoid. Kirschner wires (K-wires) and Herbert screws are implanted by surgery to realign the fractured Scaphoid bone and start healing. CAD models of K-wire and Herbert screw are constructed by measuring the implant dimensions. In this study, 3 different fixation configurations are selected viz., (1) Single Herbert Screw, (2) Herbert Screw & K-Wire and (3) Two K-Wires. For each configuration, six instances of fixations are produced, including an ideal case, a divergent case, and a convergent case for FEA. Post-surgery stability of all 18 fixation cases of the fractured Scaphoid bone is analysed by FEA under two scenarios viz., (1) tensile load of 100 N and (2) compressive load of 300 N. Results of total deformation of the Scaphoid bone and factor of safety (FOS) of the screw and wire are monitored to compare the stability of different fixation configurations. The results of our study corroborate surgeons' experience with the post-surgery instability of convergent fixations in treatment of the Scaphoid bone fractures.
